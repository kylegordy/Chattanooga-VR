# Chattanooga VR

### About

As it stands currently this is a quick proof of concept for a larger VR experience. The goal is to create a handful of high quality 360 degree images of Chattanooga that can be interacted with using a virtual reality headset. This demo currently works with the [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/) or [Google Cardboard](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/). This will allow people to explore our beautiful city from anywhere in the world.

###Specs

The 360 degree images used in this demo were created using [Google Photosphere](https://www.google.com/maps/about/contribute/photosphere/).
